A list of plugins that have aided me in development

### Android ButterKnife Zelezny

Right click in a java file to auto import all buterknife binds from a layout file

### Key Promoter X

Mouse clicking on Android Studio features will pop up the keyboard shortcut if it exists. Allows you to learn hotkeys very quickly.

### Android Localizationer

Allows the quick conversion of a strings.xml file from english to any other language.

Note of caution, keep your english simple so it can be easily translated. `\n` and other things will be translated. 

This is also a paid feature, you need to have either a google API key with translation service enabled or a microsoft key.

### CodeGlance

Adds the sublime text glance area to the code editor. Allows for quick navigation through larger files 

### Bonus: Nyan Progress Bar

Because why not :)
