Post is being rewritten. Am now running this blog off a Google Compute Instance alongside my other projects. I am also using a separate Google MySQL server for blog and other project datastore.

*Stay tuned...*

~~I have recently been investigating the [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) service on Google Cloud Platform for various APIs that I run with NodeJS. I was really impressed with the service and decided to migrate this blog over too. Post coming soon... (Once migration is fully complete) ~~
